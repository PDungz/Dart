### **Easy Level Exercises**

1. **Print Basic Values**

   - Create variables of types `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, and `dynamic`, then print their values.
   - Example: Create an `int` variable `age = 25` and print it.

2. **Differentiate Between `var`, `final`, and `const`**

   - Declare variables using `var`, `final`, and `const`. Try changing their values and observe the results.

3. **Basic List**

   - Create a list of integers and print the entire list, the first element, and the last element.

4. **Set with Unique Elements**

   - Create a set of strings, add a duplicate element, and check if the set changes.

5. **Basic Map**
   - Create a map with key-value pairs, print the entire map, and access a value using a specific key.

### **Intermediate Level Exercises**

6. **List Manipulation**

   - Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Calculate the sum, average, sort, and find the largest value in the list.

7. **Filter Data in a Set**

   - Create a set of integers.
   - Remove all odd numbers from the set.

8. **Add and Update a Map**

   - Create a map to store information about a book (title, author, year published).
   - Add a new key-value pair and update an existing value.

9. **Work with `dynamic`**

   - Initialize a `dynamic` variable, assign it values of types `String`, `int`, and `double` in sequence. Print the current type of the variable after each assignment.

10. **Use `final` with `await`**
    - Create a `final` variable and assign it the current time after a delay of 3 seconds.

### **Advanced Level Exercises**

11. **Student List Management**

    - Create a list containing the names of students.
    - Add new students, remove specific students, and sort the list alphabetically.

12. **Categorize Data in a Set**

    - Create a set containing integers from -10 to 10.
    - Separate the set into two: one containing positive numbers and the other containing negative numbers.

13. **Advanced Map Handling**

    - Create a map with product details (product ID, name, price).
    - Write a function to calculate the total price of products that cost more than 100.

14. **Use `late` with Lists**

    - Use the `late` keyword to declare a list. Initialize it after waiting for 5 seconds and then print it.

15. **Manage Multiple Lists and Sets**
    - Create two lists of integers.
    - Convert each list into a set and find the common elements and unique elements in both sets.
