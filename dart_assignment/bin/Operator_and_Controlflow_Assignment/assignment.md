Here are some advanced-level practice exercises that will help you improve your Dart programming skills by working with concepts like operators, loops, conditionals, and exception handling:

---

### **Exercise 1: String Analysis and Arithmetic**

**Description**:  
Write a program with the following requirements:

1. Input a string and count the occurrence of each character in the string.
2. Convert the string to uppercase.
3. Check if the string is a palindrome.
4. Calculate the sum of all the numbers embedded within the string. For example: "abc123def45" should give the sum of 123 + 45 = 168.

**Requirements**:

- Use operators, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Handle exceptions for invalid input (e.g., non-string input or no numbers in the string).

### **Exercise 2: Student Management System**

**Description**:  
Write a program to manage a list of students. Each student has the following attributes: Name, Math Score, Physics Score, Chemistry Score. The program should perform the following functions:

1. Add a student to the list.
2. Calculate the average score for each student and display a list of students with their average scores.
3. Display the students who have an average score above 8.
4. Find the student with the highest and lowest average scores.
5. Sort students by their average score in descending order.

**Requirements**:

- Use arrays/lists, functions, and loops.
- Use comparison operators, arithmetic operations, and handle invalid input scenarios.

### **Exercise 3: Solve a Quadratic Equation**

**Description**:  
Write a program to solve a quadratic equation of the form:  
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

- Input the coefficients a, b, and c.
- Check if a = 0 (the equation becomes linear).
- Solve the equation and output the roots (if any).
- Handle cases with no roots and duplicate roots.

**Requirements**:

- Use operators, conditionals, and loops.
- Handle edge cases such as no real roots.

### **Exercise 4: Login System**

**Description**:  
Write a program that simulates a login system with the following features:

1. Create an account with a username and password.
2. Log in with the created account (check username and password).
3. Check if the username already exists when creating a new account.
4. After three failed login attempts, notify the user and stop the program.
5. Allow the user to change the password after a successful login.

**Requirements**:

- Use arrays/lists to store account information.
- Use loops and conditionals to check the conditions.
- Handle invalid input scenarios (e.g., entering non-alphanumeric characters).

---

### **Exercise 5: CSV File Handling**

**Description**:  
Write a program that reads data from a CSV file (or simulated data) containing information about products in a store, including: Product Name, Price, Quantity. The program should perform the following functions:

1. Read and display the list of products.
2. Calculate the total value of the inventory (Price \* Quantity).
3. Find the product with the highest value.
4. Sort the products by price in descending order.
5. Update the quantity or price of a product when needed.

**Requirements**:

- Use `dart:io` to read and write files.
- Use arrays/lists to store product data.
- Handle exceptions such as non-existent files or incorrect data formats.

---

### **Exercise 6: Number Guessing Game**

**Description**:  
Write a program that creates a number guessing game:

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user guesses the number, and the program informs them whether the guess is too high or too low.
3. When the user guesses correctly, the program displays the number of attempts and asks if they want to play again.

**Requirements**:

- Use loops, conditionals, and user input/output.
- Handle invalid input scenarios (e.g., entering letters instead of numbers).

---

### **Exercise 7: Bank Account Management System**

**Description**:  
Write a program to manage a bank account with the following features:

1. Create an account (account number, account holderâ€™s name, balance).
2. Deposit money into the account.
3. Withdraw money from the account (check if the balance is sufficient).
4. View account details (balance).
5. Delete an account.

**Requirements**:

- Use arrays/lists to store account information.
- Handle edge cases like insufficient balance or deleting a non-existent account.

---

### **Exercise 8: Library Management System**

**Description**:  
Write a program to manage a library system with the following functions:

1. Add a book to the library (title, author, number of pages).
2. Remove a book from the library.
3. Display a list of all books in the library.
4. Search for a book by title or author.
5. Count the number of books in the library.

**Requirements**:

- Use arrays/lists to store book information.
- Use operators and conditionals to perform searches and display data.
